GroupingPlugin
==============

A Minecraft-Plugin to create and handle private Groups
  You can create a group and become the admin of this Group with /creategroup.
  Once you created a Group you can invite friends with /invite <Player> or simply /inv <Player>. They will recieve a Notification and can accept or decline your invite.
  To accept an open invite use the /acceptinvite command and you will autojoin the group. If you want to decline an invite use the /declineinvite command.
  When you are now not alone anymore you can use /p or /msggroup to send a message to your groupmembers. You will too recieve Notifications for a Levelup or a death of you groupmembers
    (General Deathmessages are turned off)
  To leave the current group you can simply use /leavegroup and if you are the Admin of the group your group will be resolved.
  
Features added soon:
  Maybe Items can be send within the group
